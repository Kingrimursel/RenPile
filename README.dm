# RenPile

This program is written in python. It is able to rename multiple elements at once.
Given a root word, it renames the queued elements to "word root" + an increasing integer, starting by 0.
The user gives the program a source-directory, where the program will operate.
It is then able to either rename files by a specific type or just directories, as well as all children of the given parent directory.
The program can also change the type of the queued elements.
